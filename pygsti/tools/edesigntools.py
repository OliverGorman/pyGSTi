    """Estimate the runtime for an ExperimentDesign from gate times and batch sizes.

    The rough model is that the required circuit shots are split into batches,
    where each batch runs a subset of the circuits for some fraction of the needed shots.
    One round consists of running all batches once, i.e. collecting some shots for all circuits,
    and rounds are repeated until the required number of shots is met for all circuits.

    In addition to gate times, the user can also provide the time at the end of each circuit
    for measurement and/or reset, as well as the latency between batches for classical upload/
    communication of the next set of circuits. Since times are user-provided, this function
    makes no assumption on the units of time, only that a consistent unit is used for all times.

    Parameters
    ----------
    edesign: ExperimentDesign
        An experiment design containing all required circuits.

    gate_time_dict: dict
        Dictionary with keys as either gate names or gate labels (for qubit-specific overrides)
        and values as gate time in user-specified units. All operations in the circuits of
        `edesign` must be specified. Either `gate_time_dict` or both `gate_time_1Q` and `gate_time_2Q`
        must be specified.

    gate_time_1Q: float
        Gate time in user-specified units for all operations acting on one qubit. Either `gate_time_dict`
        or both `gate_time_1Q` and `gate_time_2Q` must be specified.

    gate_time_2Q: float
        Gate time in user-specified units for all operations acting on more than one qubit.
        Either `gate_time_dict` or both `gate_time_1Q` and `gate_time_2Q` must be specified.

    measure_reset_time: float
        Measurement and/or reset time in user-specified units. This is applied once for every circuit.

    interbatch_latency: float
        Time between batches in user-specified units.

    total_shots_per_circuit: int
        Total number of shots per circuit. Together with `shots_per_circuit_per_batch`, this will
        determine the total number of rounds needed.

    shots_per_circuit_per_batch: int
        Number of shots to do for each circuit within a batch. Together with `total_shots_per_circuit`,
        this will determine the total number of rounds needed. If None, this is set to the total shots,
        meaning that only one round is done.

    circuits_per_batch: int
        Number of circuits to include in each batch. Together with the number of circuits in `edesign`,
        this will determine the number of batches in each round. If None, this is set to the total number
        of circuits such that only one batch is done.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The estimated time to run the experiment design.

    circuit_chunk_size, int, optional (default 100)
